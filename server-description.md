# Server
The server can receive and save requests. This can then be used to perform data analysis on in a later stadium. No identifying information will be contained on the server unless relevant to the research. The application should make sure that the user is aware of this as well.

The goal in the first week will be to get the server up and running. To make working on the app easier the focus will be on the API and communication, then on saving the data. Only when that is done, we will look into processing this data into a format useful to the research.

## API
*Once the API is available, the documentation will be posted here.*
